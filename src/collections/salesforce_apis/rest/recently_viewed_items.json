Salesforce stores information about record views in the interface and uses it to generate a list of recently viewed and referenced records, such as in the sidebar and for the auto-complete options in search.\n\nThis resource only accesses most recently used item information. If you want to modify the list of recently viewed items, youâ€™ll need to update recently viewed information directly by using a SOQL Query with a FOR VIEW or FOR REFERENCE clause.\nhttps://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_recent_items.htm",
