  "description": "Executes a series of REST API requests in a single call. You can use the output of one request as the input to a subsequent request. The response bodies and HTTP statuses of the requests are returned in a single response body. The entire request counts as a single call toward your API limits.\nThe requests in a composite call are called subrequests. All subrequests are executed in the context of the same user. In a subrequest’s body, you specify a reference ID that maps to the subrequest’s response. You can then refer to the ID in the url or body fields of later subrequests by using a JavaScript-like reference notation.\n\nhttps://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/resources_composite_composite.htm",
